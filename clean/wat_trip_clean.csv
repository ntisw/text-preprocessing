We visited this place on our trip through Puket Island. The temple is largest (3 floors) and most visited temple in Phuket.. The tallest building of Wat Chalong is 60 meters tall chedi sheltering a bone fragment of Lord Buddha. Temple was built at 1837. Walls and ceilings of temple are decorated with beautiful paintings from Buddha´s life. Place around is sometimes very noissy because there are loud explosions of firecrackers from brick oven.
