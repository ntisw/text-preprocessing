"My first visit to Rawai and I wasn’t much of a fan. I’ve been all over Thailand and Rawai for me is a very loud, dirty, run down little seaside town with very little to do. A local took me up here and this was the highlight of my stay here. The view is spectacular. You can get some great photos. The elephant prayer area (not really sure what you call it) was beautiful and my friend spent some time here lighting incense and laying flowers in prayer. Fortunately she had this area completely to herself during her time there. A tour bus arrived shortly after and the group was extremely loud and disrespectful so I was happy she had her private time.
