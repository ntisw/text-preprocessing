I visited this place last month. This is very famous and very crowded beach in phuket. Many activities like para gliding and boat riding are availavle. If you want to enjoy swimming you will get some area marked by rope. Outside of that area is not available for swimming. If you want to enjoy the sun light then that is a problem. You wont get seat or place to relax. The shops beside the beach is overrated. One coconut water will cost you 50 THB. Please do some research before reaching to this place. I brought a flute from here. The overall experience is very nice. The scenic beauty and the behaviour of people is outstanding. I love this place. Please do take a hotel next to this beach and you will be able to enjoy the beautiful environment in night. The bangla Street is just opposite to this beach.
