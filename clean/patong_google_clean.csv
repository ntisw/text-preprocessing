I visited this place last month. This is very famous and very crowded beach in phuket. Many activities like para gliding and boat riding are availavle. If you want to enjoy swimming you will get some area marked by rope. Outside of that area is not available for swimming. If you want to enjoy the sun light then that is a problem. You wont get seat or place to relax. The shops beside the beach is overrated. One coconut water will cost you 50 THB. Please do some research before reaching to this place. I brought a flute from here. The overall experience is very nice. The scenic beauty and the behaviour of people is outstanding. I love this place. Please do take a hotel next to this beach and you will be able to enjoy the beautiful environment in night. The bangla Street is just opposite to this beach. Very nice resturants available near to this beach. You can walk at night in sea side and enjoy the shows.

"Not a clean beach, but they had a seating area at the beach for 200 baht for two beach chairs. The water around December is quite warm, and I went at 10am.

Just have to go by the scheduled times for drop off and pick up according to the hotel. I would recommend bringing your own towel from your hotel. The beach does not offer towels. There are A LOT of street food vendors though. Anything from coconut drinks to hot foods cooked and served right on the street. I bought chicken kebabs, roti pancake with banana and sweet milk, morning glory, fried prawn balls, pork with Chinese vegetables. If you walk further down to wear the shopping district area is, you’ll pass by the food market where they were just beginning to set up but have not opened yet.
