"Its nice, very popular place, crowded, if u look on ur own then u can find better places without tourists",1,21
A great find on n our part! Completely free of cost! We were able to explore so many different areas and learn a little more about the religion!,1,28
"Must stop during Phuket land day trip with private driver (you have to search a bit for a cheap offer). Great Thai art masteriece, built last decades, panoramic view from the top! A pacefull spot.",2,35
Very clean and beautiful temple. Well maintained. People follow discipline here. You can spot the big Buddha from here on the mountain.,4,22
"My favorite price free, good for a day out, lovely architect great place to bring the family.",1,17
"Very beautiful Buddhist Temple. Great architecture. There's no entrance fee, but remember to remove your footwear before entering the temple. It's interesting to watch how they frequently burst crackers within a brick dome.  PS: Carry an umbrella and wear your socks if you love your skin and feet",5,50
Go either very early or late. Day time is very busy and very hot!,2,14
Beautiful temples and serene atmosphere…,1,5
Visited early in the morning. Very beautiful and tranquil place.,2,10
"Wat Chalong has several pretty temples in good condition and no They were in the process of renovating some of the outsides but it didn't effect the experience. There weren't too many tourists when we were there on a Friday midday during high season. When we entered the largest temple there was no one handing out sarongs, but there was someone when we got out. Better to just wear modest clothes: no tank tops and knees covered for women. Can definitely recommend a peek. Especially the inside of the main temple was gorgeous and interesting.",6,97
The temple complex is beautiful. It's well maintained as well. It was very peaceful inside and the energy is wonderful.  Great place to just let go and meditate. No guards or priests giving directions or offering to perform ceremonies.,5,40
"One of the largest and most important temples on the island. Located in the Chalong area, it receives many tourists every day. Inside the temple you feel peace and seeing yourself surrounded by Buddha is an unforgettable experience. At the top you can see the mountain and the Big Buddha. After strolling through the different temples, you can have a cold coconut and buy souvenirs. Enjoy Phuket!!! Enjoy Thailand!!!",6,69
"I personally did not enter the temple area (partly because i was wearing shorts [disrespecting the gods] and religious reasons) but i walked around the temples which had tourist “shops” which seems extremely old, dusty and filled with spider webs. I did not purchase anything and regretted because it was so cheap! some store owners will give you discounted price immediately when you touch something in the store some will give you discounts after you decide to purchase their items. items were seemly similar store to store.",3,87
In few words a picture-postcard view.This place is one of the must see places in Phuket.I was wearing off shoulder top that time and wasn't aware about the dress code that you have to follow to enter the temple. You need to wear the top which covers your shoulder and skirt or pant to the knees.But even if you are wearing something else they provide you a stall and a skirt to cover your shoulder and legs.There were amazing details in the building with great views.Definitely worth the visit.,7,90
"Buddhist temple with excellent architecture. There is no entry ticket. Both sleeping and sitting statues of Buddha are present inside hall. The temple itself is eye catching with 3 floors. Outside the temple there is a place for bursting crackers as a ritual. Another temple is there on the opposite.Some small restaurants are there and as usual with high prices.After visiting the temples, just to relax, one can walk outside to the river side. View is excellent and local people offer food to fishes and piegions.",9,86
"This is a pretty neat little temple complex.  Yes, it's still being used for ceremonial purposes, so you may see monks wondering about.  All of the buildings are clean inside and out.  There are also cats and roosters that roam the ground.  This place is a little out of the way of the main tourist areas, so it was quiet when we visited.You're required to take your shoes off when entering the buildings, and of course the normal 'temple attire' dress is required.  Would go again.",7,88
"A quiet respite from the busier tourist destinations of Phuket. Beautiful buildings and grounds, but remember that this is a temple and there is a dress code for both men and women. There are cover ups provided should you be wearing less than what is asked for entrance. There is no entrance fee.",4,53
This is an incredibly beautiful temple with so much to admire. It is a very big place and has a peaceful atmosphere. I would recommend going early in the morning and taking your time to wonder around and learn about the Thai culture. You could even witness a wedding there like I did :),4,54
Wat Chalong is a must Visit place in Phuket. The place has its own spirítual attraction with elegant architecture and eye catching building design. The campus is so beautiful and so peaceful that you would love to spend hours together. And of course photography here would give you loving memorable moments forever.The Temple is a monument in itself. Do not miss visiting the place.,6,64
Several temples on the complex with one main one and several smaller ones. The largest of the temples had many beautiful Buddha statues filling the main room. Worth a visit but not a must-see.,3,35
"A beautiful place where you can breathe in calmness and feel blessed in presence of Big Buddha. We were lucky that it was a cloudy day, Buddha right in the middle of clouds and we could see.The big Buddha has many different Buddha statues and his disciples with explanations to learn more from.This was off season, so part of temple was also under construction... But indeed we were lucky and got a beautiful view of Buddha!",4,76
Interesting architecture but extremely crowded. Not much to see inside. Should enjoy the outeriors instead.,3,15
"Wonderful place to visit, so much pleasant to eyes, rich in colour and culture. It would have been better to display description in brief in front of every temple, it's  importance and rituals to be carried out there.",2,38
"Pretty impressive temple , the surrounding is very touristic and it is pretty crowded. But you get food and drinks there. So it definitely worth a visit when you are around.",3,31
"This is a Buddhist temple. The entry inside the temple closes at 3:00 pm local time, but you can still go inside and walk around.Very peaceful and you can take pictures around. You would have a lot of opportunities to play around with light and focus if you are a photographer. Sunflower garden adds to the beauty of the temple.",5,60
"It's one of the most important Buddhist temple in Phuket. It's also very much popular with the tourist.. The Buddha statues are magnificent and from the top of the temple you can see a beautiful view.. There are more than 100 Buddha statues inside and on top of the Tomb, is a craving  which depicts Buddha's samadhi.. You will find eternal peace here...you are not allowed to touch any statues of Buddha and you are not allowed to wear a sunglass as well.",2,86
The famous Buddhist temple in Phuket. you can visit the temple on the way to Big Buddha. Mostly a crowded place. Please make sure to dress accordingly.,4,27
"The Wat Chalong is some must-see place being a tourist in Phuket. At the biggest Wat in the area you can meet locals as well and see them doing their merits. It is not a loud place but as in every other Wat as well, laughing is not forbidden.",3,50
Beautiful Buddha temple is so divine and colourful. I loved the architecture of this temple. Don't miss this temple if you are in Phuket.,3,25
"Prettiest temple on the island. Unfortunately full of rude people who have zero manners or respect towards Buddha. The wearing of shoes or hats in a temple is prohibited, but tell that to the blissful ignorant. Still worth a visit if you can close your eyes to these things.",4,49
Nice place with lot of history and tremendous buildings .. the only bad thing is that you have to dressed up and you have to buy or rent clothes outside the palace in order to enter it . The row is not big so you don’t have to wait so long . It takes about two and a half hours to explore all the building so take some water with you and be prepared with the proper clothes with long sleeves sunglasses and maybe a hat,3,87
"Very beautiful.  It is good to religious ppl - this fact alone brings order & discipline in life.  When a country lacks faith in religion,  like The U. S., there is mayhem chaos & divisions",3,35
Very beautiful Temple and the architecture was really Excellent.. you will get inner peace when you go there.. one of the best Temple in phuket,1,25
"Beautiful temple with good access, parking and facilities. Felt peaceful even with lot of people around. Lots of well-placed rocks under shade to meditate or relax.",3,26
Despite it being a public holiday it felt easy to get around. There were crowds but there were no queues. In places it felt serene. We could meditate and just BE. Crackers are set off in the cracker chimney and are really loud,5,43
A beautiful temple with brilliant architecture and paintings. Very peaceful . Has a dress code as it is a holy place .,3,22
Beautiful place. Must visit place in Phuket. We could witness rich culture and glory of Buddhism!!,3,16
"Famous attrations have a lot of overseas visitors and locals,  temples and the pagoda are well maintained and keep tidy. With bare feet walking up both of them and viewing the Buddhas in each level giving you a peaceful mind and recap the beautiful moments of the pass.",2,48
"nice and relaxing atmosphere, however its really touristic spot with many tour group, so if you want to go somewhere for a peace of mind this place might not provide that. but if you need to visit a temple with well manage and beautiful scene to take a photo and make a wish in the same place, this place is the answer.",2,62
Chalong Temple is one of the most popular and holy temple in Phuket. Very beautiful temple and surrounded by good nature views. A must to visit place in Thailand.,3,29
Peaceful place to spend some time. It has many small Temples. The architecture of the temples signify the Thai culture. People also perform some rituals in the temples. I wish there was a guide to explain about these temples and their history. Otherwise the place has got some boards explained about the particular place.They have parking place for tourist vehicles.It takes about half an hour to visit all the temples in this place.,8,73
"Very beautiful and calm place. This place has a history and mythical links to Buddha's life. There are some beliefs about Buddha for which people here have made certain rules, and I request everyone to kindly abide by them. A very peculiar ritual I observed here is that when people's wishes get fulfilled they come back here to burst crackers to show their happiness. The temple complex even has a chimney for this.",5,75
Amazing experience with our guide explaining things and showing us what to do at each point in the visit. Would go again as it was abit rushed and I eoukd have liked more time there.,2,35
This is my go to place to send off prayers and show gratitude. I love visiting the temples every 2 weeks or so.. never ceases to amaze me.,2,28
Great place to explore local Temple. People should be mindful of their clothing here as it is a religious place,2,20

We spent about half an hour here, since that was d time alloted by our tour guy.Once u enter d temple, u feel d peace n quietness inside u. Its just so peaceful here. Don't miss out on this visit.",8,82
"Good place to visit ,but there should be proper boarding in English to explain the significance.this was better then bug budha (not so commercial)",2,24
"a peaceful place. there are some temples in one area. there is also a museum with a beautiful ornament and many statues in it. i really amazed with the detail ornament in every corner of the building. the shocked moment was that when a man put a lot firecracker inside of a stack of bricks, and fire it, so i could hear a huge sound from it and that stack is near the temple. i was just wondered, aren't the people disturbed with that sound?",6,86
"Amazing tample to loose yourself for couple of hours, admiring the architecture and the importance that locals give to it.",1,20
