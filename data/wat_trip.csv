"I was wearing off shoulder top that time and wasn't aware about the dress code that you have to follow to enter the temple. You need to wear the top which covers your shoulder and skirt or pant to the knees.
But even if you are wearing something else they provide you a stall and a skirt to cover your shoulder and legs.There were amazing details in the building with great views.Definitely worth the visit.",5,78
"Temple of 2 famous monks,,,, Luang Po Chaem and Luang Po Chuang ---- both famous for herbal medicine and tending to the injured.",2,22
Wat Chalong is one of the most impressive and most popular temples in Phuket. I had really short time to explore the temple but I was very surprised. There were a lot of tourists but it was expected because of the high season. Impressive temple you must visit it. Just you need more than hour to explore the temple.,5,59
These temples are astounding. They are so ornate. It was stunningly beautiful to see in person. Please be mindful of dress code tho for ladies no singlets or short shorts.,4,30
"This temple is so magical, the place is located in nice area so a good ride along ,the views from it are great and the architecture and art work is amazing and spectacular. Plan at least an hour for this visit to enjoy and see all the corners.",2,48
Renowned temple made up of several buildings.. Seems popular with locals too.. Main difference is you hear fire crackers sounding off repeatedly as a way for blessings and thanking of Gods.,3,31
This is the major landmark of Phuket. Wat is very important historical moment of Phuket. Phuket people pay high respect to the monk status of this Wat.,3,27
"This was one the one stop in our tour that was any good. The temple was absolutely gorgeous, with intricate details abound and towering spires. The complex was quite nice as well, with several stands for shopping and places to snag cold beverages to slake the nasty heat",3,48
Wat Chalong is a good place to visit if you go to Phuket. It's a nice place for good pictures and also to see a little bit more of the religion and culture.,2,34
"Many buildings to visit and the main one provides a magnificent view of the area from the 3rd floor.  I visited this temple as part of a one day tour with the Chalong Buddha, which was amazingly impressive.",3,38
Impressive buildings and sculptures and well worth the visit.  You can pray or just walk around taking it all,2,19
Lovely trip to Chalong Temple. Beautiful buildings and views too. Well worth a trip to appreciate the majesty of the place.,3,21
Great to see. Beautiful temple with many lovely statues. Lighting of the firecrackers in the brick building is amazing to hear. Moderate dress is required.,4,25
Chalong Temple is a priceless temple of Phuket people. Is very beautiful. Convenient parking. The atmosphere inside the shady temple. Is a place with beautiful Thai art.,5,27
"I like visiting temples and churches whatever country I visit and this one didn’t disappoint, beautiful structures with the most ornate decorations on them. In side the temple was spotlessly clean with the most spectacular Buddha’s iin gold.",4,39
"A must-see place if you are in Phuket, there are many temples are in campus and no entry fees, parking is easily available..all the temples are very colourful and with great architecture...story of Buddha life has been painted on the walls...devotees there pray",4,48
This is a nice couple of temples but you can easily get through in about 20 minutes. There some shops selling trinkets and drinks,3,24
"Amazing temple - colourful, beautiful, magnificent inside out. Since it was the first and only buddhism temple that I visited I found it super exciting.",2,24
Good for a short visit. The architecture from outside is very good. I went during peak noon and it was v v hot. Otherwise an v good place. With the visit.,4,30
Very beautiful temple and an amazing opportunity to learn about local culture and history. A free activity which is worth a visit particularly if combined with the Big Buddha.,2,29
"I felt like I had to rate this 4 stars, because of the beautiful temple grounds, and what it stands for, but there are so many people running around, and these crazy loud fireworks, that will scare you the first time you hear them!!  It's almost a contradiction to a spiritual",2,52
This place is peaceful and its like you enter another world all together.the monk was also kind enough to do a prayer for our kid.overall its a must when in phuket,2,35
"We were delighted to get to see this temple, only 20 mins from Kata Beach. Free entry, cover shoulders if you can. Shawls are provided when entering temples. Shoes removed, bare footed walk. It was very warm inside, we all came out sweaty.",5,43
"If you are on your first visit to Thailand, you'll love the Wat. But it is of course disappointing compared to the amazing temples in Bangkok, Chiang Mai etc. The Buddha statues seemed relatively new / modern.",3,37
Beautiful gold statues of the Buddha.  Vast place to roam around the ground of the temple. We took lots of photos here!,3,22
We decided to go and check out some of the more traditional cultural attractions in Phuket so we took a taxi from our hotel in Kata (700β to go to temple and wait then on to Old Phuket Town) and checked out the temple. The temple grounds are well manicured and look nice,2,54
"This place has such a lovely feeling, amazing attention to detail in the temples Highly Recommend .. A must see",2,19
Part of standard island tours - wouldn’t go there in isolation personally unless it was part of the organized itinerary,1,20
"Bangkok was also a feast for the eyes. Did you know it has over 9 million inhabitants? An extremely religious city, we travelled around visiting ancient temples and palaces, and made sure we went to Wat Kalayanamit (Thailand’s largest indoor sitting Buddha at 15 metres/49 feet",2,45
"Avery nice temple with a lot to see around.  In this temple you often hear the load noise of firecrackers that they offer. Nice view from third floor, many Buddha statues inside. garden is well taken care of.",4,40
"I visited once with the family and it's worse the trip. It's a short drive right after Phuket Town. Please do not wear singlet, shorts that are above knee and buy encens stick to pray for whatever you wish to you and your loved ones. Very nice coving and statues of various",4,54
Went to Wat Chalong with little to no expectation but was pleasantly surprised. Was in awe of the magnificent structures. Even witnessed some people worshipping. Have to be respectful of others in the temples and avoid taking pictures of people worshipping and to dress,4,44
"Rushing for time during our visit here as our tour schedule was a little bit off track.  We could only spend about 30 minutes at this location before departing to the next attraction site. Anyway, a nice place with a few stunning and amazing temples we have seen so far. ",3,50
"Beautiful temple, captures the peacefulness of the people. Amazing to walk up-down and around with photos to be takes at every-corner. The silence is broken by crackers being let off in thanks. Rather quiet and easy to get around. There is a little market on the side with good",5,52
"Sometimes Thailand and Phuket can get a bit to much with crowds, tourists, touts etc, places like Wat Chalong are a beautiful sanctuary (even on a crowded day). The buildings are beautiful and so well adorned. There is no entrance fee and modest attire is recommended",4,46
"Awesome to see but highlights the difference between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" in Thailand.  Feels a bit like a business",2,22
"Nice gardens, free entry. We arrived late so didn’t go into many of the temples. Had a lovely wander around the gardens. Decent toilets on site and somewhere to get a cold drink! Shade in places, which is lovely when the heat really kicks in.",4,46
"Big temple , huge bhduda images in the great area.  it is special and beautiful temple in Phuket.   The guide was helpful and knowledgeable.",3,23
"Beautiful interiors to the temples. Loads going on around i.e. food, drink, market stands etc too. Lovely gardens and informative boards on display.",3,23
"There are multiple buildings/temples within the compound area. The main temple is located towards the end. This has multiple floors. Shape of the buildings is quite intriguing. You can see people offering there prayers. You too can do that.There are a lot of shops in the vicinity. We visited during the day time and there were multiple instances when crackers were burnt. While passing this temple, in the evening, it looked more beautiful with all the lights in place. But at the same time it was more crowded as well.Although there is a parking lot nearby, but we were charged 60 THB for the same whereas the slip said 20 THB.",10,113
We visited this place on our trip through Puket Island. The temple is largest (3 floors) and most visited temple in Phuket.. The tallest building of Wat Chalong is 60 meters tall chedi sheltering a bone fragment of Lord Buddha. Temple was built at 1837. Walls and ceilings of temple are decorated with beautiful paintings from Buddha´s life. Place around is sometimes very noissy because there are loud explosions of firecrackers from brick oven. That is a some way to make merit when one of your wishes came true.,7,89
"Must stop during Phuket land day trip with private driver (you have to search a bit for a cheap offer). Great Thai art masteriece, built last decades, panoramic view from the top! A pacefull spot.",3,35
"Beautiful temples which are wellkept, and I think most people will find a visit here worth the time. Be aware that the main temple is over many floors so be prepared for quite a few stairs to climb.",2,38
Amazing place. A MUST to visit. Convenient and staffs there were friendly. I loved the place very much.,4,18
The sightseing had some Thai temples with very beautiful and interesting architecture. Many statues and paintings of the local culture and buddhist religion,1,24
"So nice to actually experience some old style Thai culture, architecture and spirituality.. A trip highlight for us!",2,18
It was terribly crowded even on a weekday but the place was interesting as a place of religion. Avoid revealing clothes,2,21
"Visited this beautiful temples with my teenage son as part of the city tourImpressive architecture and amazing details in the each temple.
Each temple can be entered (shoes off) and one you can climb the tower for a high view of the area. Among the many tourists buzzing around in peak season you still get a feel of the peacefulness and calmness.
This is well worth a visit.",4,68
If u r Buddhist then it won't be boring for you since you come here for praying. Others may just spend 15 minutes to visit the temples.,2,28
"Apparently the most important Temple in Phuket. It is photogenic with it’s red and golden finish, however not in a league of others throughout Thailand. Plenty of nice gardens and good parking. Free entry.",5,35
