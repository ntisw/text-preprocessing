"Went here on a fabulous clear day, the views are lovely but the highlight for me was the elephant shrine. It was really lovely. I wouldn’t make a special trip if you were staying the other side of the island however if you have time it is a lovely place to stop ",3,53
We just in time reached the cape to see the sunset which was way too awesome. There is a fantastic view from the top. The ride to the cape was also cool. A must see place if you are around Phuket. And the best time would be for the sunset. ,5,50
The place can get crowded during sunset but its worth the visit. We went there via motorbike and stopped to karon viewpoint and nai harn beach along the way. Sunset was amazing looking over the horizon. About 40min drive from Patong area. ,4,44
"I think Chaithararam Temple is the best and preserved temple in Phuket: it's a spiritual place where you can enjoy and experience on live some traditions the monks are having if you are lucky: i got the moment where they lighting the candles.Not so crowded as I expected, you can have beautiful pictures.recommended the visit.",3,56
"Been many times and have contributed many photos over the years. Will continue to do so because it is my favourite place on Phuket. The views are amazing surrounding the area and the waters are crazy. If you like adventure, walk out to the point. Wear good shoes and be safe. Do not attempt it if you have a medical condition, take water and use sunscreen. The point can get rough if there is a storm coming in, be cautious of the waves, they have a way of sneaking up on you if you get too close. You can not swim around this are and are foolish if you try.",8,110
"This is Thailand's sunset point that your should not miss when you are in Phuket.  The atmosphere is so nice. If you wear a sport shoes, walk down to the cliff to spend good moments with nature. ",3,37
"Same as windmill viewpoint,  look at the andaman sea.   There are a lot of parking lot,  it is good to drive and visit.  ",2,23
"It is undoubtedly one of the best spots on the island to watch the sunset but the crowd is crazy so in my opinion it’s a bit overrated. There are many other beautiful but quiet places without massive crowds of mostly Chinese people. They don’t even care about the sunset. They click their photo, turn around and leave without even looking at the sun! They are loud and noisy. The place is probably still worth a visit but I wouldn’t go there again. Unless there is some secret spot to hide from the insanity",6,97
"Nice views from the top but we came when the sun was hitting directly above us, so we had to find a shade and just enjoy the views. ",1,28
"Considered as one of Phuket tourism Almost everyone has to visit the scenery and take pictures of the sunset. People will be very tight if it is during the holidaywatch the time well. Most people will go ahead to find a place But ats. Parking is less. Must the point of being able to walk down But be careful, the elderly and children do not recommend walking down.",5,68
The unbreakable serene and romantic ambience of Promthep Cape encourages everyone to visit the picturesque panoramic landscape with the most stunning view. It is a great checkpoint where a few selfies are considered not enough. Its sunset hour is the most romantic moment inspiring a profoundly positive mood.,3,49
"You can watch a nice view and sunset from here. Parking space is limited, if you drive by your own. No need to pay anything. ",3,25
"It was a unplanned visit to have sunset at this point. Wanted to spend one hour. But due to time constraint, was able to spend only 20 minutes. But the sunset view from this location was awesome. Calm sea and sunset - a great combination. Don't miss this. ",6,48
A must visit place in phuket. The views from Promthep Cape is absolutely stunning. I visited during daytime. I am told sunset views are amazing.   In case you want to see sunset start early as the road gets crowded.  Promthep cape is a place not be missed at any cost ,6,50
A bit crowded with tourists upon arrival but never stopped us from squeezing to the cliff front to have a good view . Wonderful & refreshing view from the top while watching the sun to set beyond the horizon . Its indeed the best place to view the sunset !  ,3,48
"From the cape there is an enthralling view opens on the neighboring beaches: Nai Harn, Ya Nui and Rawai. At the top there are numerous shops and cafes; also there is a monument to the sub-lieutenant and some Buddhist stands.  ",2,41
"Recommend trekking down for a nicer view of the sunset. Fewer people there too. Path on the way down is very rocky and dangerous, wear shoes! View is worth the walk. Come around 1730, sun sets around 1830. Sunset was beautiful! It is a must to visit this place.  ",5,49
You can not go to Phuket and not visit here.  Such a beautiful place to visit and the sunsets are amazing. ,2,
Must visit in phuket. We went as a part of city tour but will suggest to go self via bike or taxi so that you can spend maximum time enjoying view. ,2,31
"With the amazing amount of tourists, this place still offers plenty of view for a very nice photo shot.  Plenty of parking and plenty of space ",2,26
Amazing views of islands breaches and sunset not far to the seafood markets and restaurants of Rawai beach  Must do  ,1,20
The view at Phromthep Cape is stunning. You can even walk to the very tip - that proved to be a bit tricky in flip flops though. Avoid visiting at peak hours as it is unbearably hot. ,3,36
Very beautiful and stunning scenery. We were amazed by this place as it is very beautiful. Some serious nature here! ,3,20
A must place to visit for any Phuket traveller. Beautiful view on a peaceful place. Can be growded during High season,3,21
Very beautiful sunsets. We came here several times and enjoyed the beauty of the setting sun in the horizon of the ocean,2,22
"Very honestly, it’s a brilliant sunset point and that’s about it .. if you are into sunsets you will absolutely love it and give this place a 4/5 but if you are looking for something more than it is a 3/5 kinda place.
We rented a Tuk Tuk from Patong and it costed us around 200 Thai Bhat(it’s better if you rent a vehical for the entire day and explore points like these) We went in the evening just before sunset. The vibe is brilliant, local musicians playing music, dancers dancing and lots of other activities. There a small stalls outside selling local street food but I don’t trust the quality. Just outside the main entrance there are small cafes, I had the banana crep from there and it was amazing and costed me 20 Thai bhat. The sunset beautiful and makes for great instagram pictures. There is an elephant shrine there and",7,158
"Really can't see the point in this place unless you are in the north and desperate to see a sunset! Bus loads of people are brought in and jostle each other for the best vantage point. The sun sets out to sea so there isn't even anything scenery wise to contrast with the sunset. We were staying in Nai Harn and walked to Promthep, we didn't wait for the sunset as we had better perspectives from our hotel balcony.",3,82
"Spent our last day making random stops, this was one. We hired to taxi driver to drive us around to site seed for a few hours. It’s really pretty here, just a quick stop if you make a plan for the day and have time.",3,46
"This would be a great place to be at sunset. The view from the top is beautful, the walk up is very moderate and easy. Nice spot to just sit and relax.",3,32
"If you have enough time and go around in the island you need to see that. We didn't go there in sunrise, but it worth to look around in noon as well.",2,33
One of the best view in Phuket. I enjoyed the short walk and the views. If you like photography you must visit this place. You could discover different and beautiful views that you can capture. You will be impressed.,5,39
"Great views, especially at sunset. Popular spot so the crowds were out in force. Nice to relax and enjoy and savour the moment.",3,23
"On its slope you can have a picknick with one of the most beautiful views from the island. For the obvious reasons, I'd recommend to visit the place in the evenings, just before the sunset. Google about the surroundings, you'll find places to visit in the area for to almost all tastes even after the sunset, from the very quiet to the very lively. Very nice hotels can be found close-by, but do book in advance! Do drink plenty of water (even after the sunset) and always wear your sunscreen on unprotected parts of your body and your sunglasses during the day. Never leave the latter behind",5,110
"As advertised, the place offers great views during the sunset. You can take some beautiful pictures. Can be a bit crowded though, so you’d better be there early to find a place to sit and enjoy.",3,37
"Promthep Cape was a wonderful visit for me i took a motorbike and parked nearby, strolled up to the view point and wow what a view, you can hike down the peak and get really close to the sea which was also a great experience, although there was a large crowd of tourists doing the same thing as me took away some of the unique feeling of this location. If i was to go again it would be early morning.",2,80
We are lucky to arrive on sunny days where the view was great. Pick the right time to come because this place is popular among tourists.,2,26
"My first visit to Rawai and I wasn’t much of a fan. I’ve been all over Thailand and Rawai for me is a very loud, dirty, run down little seaside town with very little to do. A local took me up here and this was the highlight of my stay here. The view is spectacular. You can get some great photos. The elephant prayer area (not really sure what you call it) was beautiful and my friend spent some time here lighting incense and laying flowers in prayer. Fortunately she had this area completely to herself during her time there. A tour bus arrived shortly after and the group was extremely loud and disrespectful so I was happy she had her private time. If you’re in the area, this is something to check out. Be strategic with your visiting hours. The less people the better the experience.",11,150
Very nice (but steep) walk up to see beautiful views of the islands. It was crowded but still serene. I would recommend it if you are in Phuket.,3,28
"Nice viewpoint any time of day. I read that it is quite crowded at sunset so we chose to go around 2pm. I think even 4pm would be fine, just before the crowds.Instead, we chose to watch a sunset from Sabai Corner which was awesome whilst having dinner! See my other review.",4,55
"An exceptional viewpoint to take in the turquoise waters surrounding Phuket.The 360 degree views are a beautiful background to wedding shoots or even group photos. The majestic landmark is a must visit and then make your way to Rawai Pier and enjoy the views and fresh sea food that can be purchased and cooked in the restaurants opposite.Beautiful fresh sea food, reasonably priced.",4,65
Challenge yourself exploring further so you can sneak out to quiet spot ... we went there on Sunday so its even more crowded.. it was a lovely sunset we had,1,
"I'm visiting this site on the last day of my vacation in phuket. Me and my friends want to have a view of sunset.Instead we're meeting with a lot of tourist, the place is okay, just too crowded",2,41
Great place to watch sun go down. Popular but plenty of space to get your perfect insta worthy photo.,2,19
"This is Thailand's sunset point that your should not miss when you are in Phuket.The atmosphere is so nice. If you wear a sport shoes, walk down to the cliff to spend good moments with nature.",3,37
"Really nice place, not to crowded if you go to the end of it - it’s ‘cause almost everybody will stay in the beginning.Also good spot for taking pictures.Free entrance.Up on a hill are statues with elephants.",4,40
"Promthep Cape is d southern most point of Phuket. We took a 2wheeler on rent from near our hotel in Patong and rode to Promthep Cape.Its a 30 to 40 minute ride. On the way u can visit Karon Beach/Kata Beach/Karon View Point.Best time to visit is during sunset. Its just so beautiful. Place is crowded, but not too much. Find a quiet spot for urselves and enjoy d sunset. There's a small temple too on d top. It's like a 5 to 10 minute hike to reach d view point. Entry is free. Place is well maintained. Absolutely worth d 40 minute ride from city centre. We loved it here. The 40 minute journey is picturesque. Must visit. Its usually not included in itineraries bcoz it's far.",14,139
"This tucked away viewpoint is beautiful at sunset, there is a refreshment and ice cream stall here and restaurants nearby.",1,20
This is the place for sunsets. Gorgeous. Only problem is the crowds who have the same time. Suggest you go down to the Windmill or just Nai Harn Beach for a similar effect.,4,33
"Great viewpoint we saw on a tour with Phuket Travel Co. There is a lovely little market with snacks and goods, very reasonable prices. Drinks are 10-20 bht instead of the crazy prices of Patong",3,36
This was good and you have to walk on a grave road. This was really good experience. you can you to shore of the see.,3,25
