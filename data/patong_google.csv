Nothing special and Alot of shoppers,1,6
An amazingly clean beach. The smell of the city is horrible but im not rating Phuket just the beach.,2,20
The water is disgusting. Dont come here.,2,7
Main beach area Patong close to Bangela road.Water is not clear and shallow...great water attractions..not so crowded.,3,20
One of the most popular beaches in Phuket.,1,20
"Mooi strand, wel wilde golven",1,5
"Beautiful place, sunset is amazing!!",1,5
"Worst place in thailand, too crowded, smells really bad, ugly people and super noisy. I do not recommend to go there under any circumstances. Go to another beaches instead, like karon beach",3,32
I visited this place last month. This is very famous and very crowded beach in phuket. Many activities like para gliding and boat riding are availavle. If you want to enjoy swimming you will get some area marked by rope. Outside of that area is not available for swimming. If you want to enjoy the sun light then that is a problem. You wont get seat or place to relax. The shops beside the beach is overrated. One coconut water will cost you 50 THB. Please do some research before reaching to this place. I brought a flute from here. The overall experience is very nice. The scenic beauty and the behaviour of people is outstanding. I love this place. Please do take a hotel next to this beach and you will be able to enjoy the beautiful environment in night. The bangla Street is just opposite to this beach. Very nice resturants available near to this beach. You can walk at night in sea side and enjoy the shows. Thanks.,18,171
A little crowded beach however much cleaner than expected,1,9
Party area! bars and entertainment .,1,6
"Visited in December. The weather was pleasant, a bit on the warmer side. Maintained beach but could be a little cleaner. A lot of activities here including parasailing but with no life guard on duty. Many food stalls along the beach. Best to rent a scooter and explore the entire beach. Volleyball nets available. THB 200 for chair",8,58
"Great beach,clean and well kept and absolutely safe even at odd hours.close to anything one may want like a 7/11 or a money changer.Walkable distance to most of the hostels and places of interest in the area.Plenty of eating options - from the market serving fresh fish to small shops where locals eat.all within walking distance so one may explore on foot",3,62
"Patong Beach - One of the most popular beach in the island, full of life all the time. It's right in the middle of all the action, water sports, partying, etc etc. You can find a bunch of restaurants, spas, and bars for the full range of experiences.",2,48
A bit crowded but still one of the best spots in Phuket to capture sunset. You can bring you all foods and drinks to enjoy the view here with friends.,2,30
"Not a clean beach, but they had a seating area at the beach for 200 baht for two beach chairs. The water around December is quite warm, and I went at 10am. The hotel is stay at offers a shuttle ride to the beach, but the ride was a 10 minute drive if I’m estimating correctly. It was a short ride. The shuttle picks you up to go back to the hotel too. Just have to go by the scheduled times for drop off and pick up according to the hotel. I would recommend bringing your own towel from your hotel. The beach does not offer towels. There are A LOT of street food vendors though. Anything from coconut drinks to hot foods cooked and served right on the street. I bought chicken kebabs, roti pancake with banana and sweet milk, morning glory, fried prawn balls, pork with Chinese vegetables. If you walk further down to wear the shopping district area is, you’ll pass by the food market where they were just beginning to set up but have not opened yet. They also offer massages at the beach on top of many others trying to sell tourists things such as grapefruits and fried foods, beach cover-ups, and sunglasses (knockoff ray-bans).",11,210
"It's very famous among  tourist and you will always find this beach crowded.. So if you are looking for some peace and me time, this ain't the beach.. On the other hand, if you are up for some water sports like jet ski or Para gliding, this is the place to be.. Also lot of bars around the beach which are quite lively",4,63
"Beautiful beach with great waters for water sports like jet skis. Be prepared for lots of haggling if you’re interested in water sports, all the printed prices are around double of what the real prices are. Lots of great places to eat at walking distance, remember to wear lots of sun screen and drink lots of water as it can get quite sunny!",3,63
"Quite nice beach with beautiful views, warm blue water and yellow sand. Lots of Thai food, fruits and drinks sold nearby. Close to city streets, bars and shops. Not as crowded as Karon beach or few others. You will enjoy relaxing there.",5,42
"The best and most happening beach in Phuket. This place is always full of tourists. One can also do Parasailing, Jet Skiing etc. but do negotiate the cost beforehand. Great place to spend time in the evening and have a bath as well. The beach is very clean and full of pubs nearby.",5,53
"Very nice beach, with everything to buy on the beach or near, watersports, large for 5km, and tide friendly (even in the low tide is a good beach). No showers however..",2,31
Not the Cleanest and Best beach in Phuket. That has to be Kata / Karon Beach. But this Beach is lively located very close to the night life and all the Happening places in Phuket. This is a beach to chill for a while before you hit the shopping or party scene hard!!!,4,53
"Beautiful beach. Crowded due to its popularity as expected, so go elsewhere if you aren’t comfortable with this
$200 Baht for hiring 2 chairs and 1 umbrella for the day which is great. Drink/food prices reasonable",4,36
"Very nice location but I was bitten by alot of fleas there.... my legs were ruined there... 83 spots on both legs in an hour....",3,25
"Not clean at all and lots of people bother you to try and sell you something, better at night",1,19
Clean beach. Early morning swims with quiet waves is what anyone would wish for in a holiday. Lovely park around. Has quite a lot of sun beds. Loved this place,5,30
"Beautiful beach. Especially when it's less busy. Walk down and being a beach towel and enjoy the sun and the swim. Waves are calm. Throughout the day there are plenty of locals trying to sell you something. Plenty of offered activities such as jetski, banana boat, donuts, parachuting and so on. There are toilet blocks on the beach. May cost you a few baht for use.  If you see a local called Mike trying get you to buy tourism packages, I recommend him.",9,83
"Nice experience, Beach is clean and beautiful place to relax.",1,10
"Nice, but local sellers are heavy talkers and sticky , smoking is not allowed at the beach which is awful",1,20
Had a great time in Patong beach. Clean beach with very fine sands. The waves at the beach go up and down all day gives a wonderful swimming experience.  I tried the parasailing at 1300 baht but for only 4 minutes. Expensive but great experience,5,45
"Clean, beautiful and lively. They charge 300 baht for an umbrella and 2 loungers during daytime. You can sit there and relax as long as you want. They sell drinks and fruits there also.Another option, you can buy your own mat and there's a designated area for free seating. You can buy your drinks and food from outside and have it there.",6,62
"Worst experience in my life. Don't bother come in here for New Year. Over crowded and the traffic controller prioritise cars and bikes over pedestrians. Screaming ""Move Move!"" And pushing people. I got tased, kids around were crying. It's a nightmare. It will ruin your trip. Don't come to Patong. Phuket isn't even good. There are a lot of better places to go in Thailand.",8,65
"A nice beach, a lot of water-based attraction like banana boat or flying with reasonable price, not quite clean but the view during the sunset is really good.",1,28
Beautiful beach but there is so much commercialization. Prices of goods and services around are also sky high. Beach is still good for relaxing overall.,3,25
patong beach is good beach on the road side and you can see crowd enjoying and relaxing there . There are few hotels and resorts nearby and also walking street is nearby so you can enjoy the evenings there too. If you want to enjoy beach like a private experience go at the beach side which is just in front of the novotel resort.,3,64
"It's a lovely place, lovely beach, you can enjoy here throughout the day and night also, all kind of water sports are available here, you can enjoy the same or just lay down and enjoy the beautiful sea, you can also take bath in the sea. Nightlife is also very happening over here, you can do lots of activities. Also you can find variety of food and drinks in the restaurant along with the beach.",4,75
