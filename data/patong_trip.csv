"A busy but exciting beach with plenty of exiting opportunities for sports etc. Excellent local restaurants and bars, shops etc.",3,20
Besides the location not much going for it especially as there are so many fantastic beaches all around Patong and Phuket in general.,1,23
"Patong Beach was absolutely amazing.  There are a bunch of restaurants that will provide you with great food and some shade when you need a break from the water.  Jet skis, parasailing and various water activities also await you here.  I was here for New Years Eve and the beach…",4,50
"The beach and restaurants are ok, don’t come here for a relaxing holiday. Come here when you want to party and to date. The area has very nice places to visit. The traffic is busy and the distances to the nice sceneries to visit James Bond rock it’s about 100 km.",4,51
"Not a nice beach, over crowded and dirty. Would definitely avoid if possible. But if that didn’t bother you than give it a go.",4,24
I was very surprised how clean the beach was and even over New Years it never felt too busy. Clear water. Some nice beach bars along the front too.,3,29
"Very beautiful beach but very crowded . Too many water excursion people and long tail boats .  Will Recommend Paradise Beach , the best beach in Phuket , there is entrance fee of 200 bahts bt its worth paying .  Should also visit Karon and Kata Beach , Very clear water and very…",3,53
"Great beach for relaxing and people watching. Beautifully clean, there is a no smoking policy in place on the beach now but plenty of smoking areas. Great food and drink stands catering for every taste. The chicken kebabs and the potato skewers are lovely. There are plenty of…",5,48
We went to Celebrity Ink and were more than impressed Patrick went above and beyond to make sure everything went better than we could imagine . If you’re looking for a tattoo this is definitely the place to go !!,2,40
"We have been to Patong Beach many times with our children (18,13 & 8) and while it is a very busy place and you will be asked 100s of times if you want to buy something , it can still be a relaxing place. The surf is so small that the kids are safe to swim in it. You can sit…",3,61
"Beach it itself is clean enough (unlike others I have visited in Thailand), but given an average score as prices are high for sunbed use, drinks and food. It is hard to relax due to the number of people trying to sell you sunglasses, jewellery and anything else you can think of",2,52
It's the most popular beach in Phuket filled up with tourists till sunset. I would'nt recommend it to you if you are looking for some me time as it's always crowded but i won't give it a bad review for that as well.,2,43
"Bangla road is over-estimated and expensive. It is quiet in the morning and extremely busy and overcrowded at night. The saying: “ if it’s too loud, you are too old” - might be applicable, though my experience is: too loud, too busy and too expensive. Be careful: they sell fake…",4,50
Overcrowded with very rude Europeans unfortunately.. the typical Asian beach experience.FULL of sun loungers and people hounding you to purchase goods..,3,21
"If you are staying in Patong, this is an easy clean cute beach to access. Just a basic beach, must get there early if you want shade or a lounge chair. They need to add more chairs, that’s my only complaint. But for a free, local easy access beach. It works! Obviously, it’s…",5,53
"Patong beach is one of the worst beaches I've been to in Thailand, as it's overcrowded with tourists and dirty. There were no nice food stands to order from, so it can't even touch beaches in Hua Hin, Pattaya and Koh Chang to name a few. Katong beach which is the nearest…",3,52
"Patong Beach  Patong  738012982  Of all the places in the world to take off my sandals and stroll the beach, this one is it. Simply stated, access to this beach is an eye blink from along the roadside where one finds Para sailing one of the most fascinating activities, along…",1,50
"We spent NYE wandering along Bangla Road. What a wild and crazy atmosphere!  Not a place to bring your children, even on non holiday evenings/nights though.",3,26
"Wondrerful white sandy beach.  Many beach clubs with amenities - pools, food, drinks poolside or seated in pools, showers and toilet facilities.  Water from Andaman Sea is calm and nice to float in!  Skidoos and kite sailing available.  Everything for beach lovers like me!",4,44
We decided to spend Christmas Day 2019 at Patong Beach as we had been planning since early October! The beach was fairly crowded and the water is a bit dirty (in comparison to other Thai beaches) but overall it was a nice experience. We found some space among the people…,3,50
"The Patong Beach is very well maintained. Beach and water are fairly clean, with many water activities to do. Swimmers are separated from all the other activities so you can enjoy your swim in peace. There are a lots of restaurants, bars and cafes along the beach, as well as…",4,50
We was staying in Patong for three weeks and went to the beach most days  It is a long beach if you walk from one ent to the other Can be a bit busy John,1,35

"We really enjoyed swimming & relaxing on the Patong beach, it was just 5min walk to our hotel. there is so much to do here, swimming, jet skii, parasailing. My daughter really enjoyed it here. while in the beach, dont forget to enjoy their pancakes & make your own icecream with…",4,51
"it can get a bit crowded, busy and noisy, but it is a very good place to watch the sunset, but it is a very convenient beach with a lot of shops and restaurants, not so perfect for couples who look for romantic holidays but perfect for family.",1,48
Thailand has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world and Patong beach is one of them. Offering different kinds of water sports and a sea as warm as a bath. Plenty of beach sellers selling anything from cold drinks to sunglasses. The seller's are very nice and if you…,4,51
"USA resident and international traveler here: I was not at all impressed with Patong. Save yourself a trip and go to the Mexican Riviera Maya instead. The beach was dirty, the streets stink, and the hustlers on and around the beach are overwhelming. Everyone said this place…",3,47
"Stayed at Blue Ocean Resort. Easy walk to Patong beach passing many restaurants, bars & shops..  Longboat rides, jet skis & parachuting or just lazing on the beach. Plenty of opportunities to book a variety of trips to other islands or places of interest.",4,44
Dirty looking water beach attractions that seemed a total rip off mainly parachute crack.. after watching I timed the air time and a disgusting 1 minute 20 seconds for something like 2000 baht,2,33
"Beautiful white sand beach, a little crowded and noisy in high season. Amazing water, warm and clean I recommend fresh fruit juices sold by merchants near the beach.. are excellent",2,30
One of the most spectacular beaches of Asia drawing tourists from around the world and filled with activity. The beach is clean and lined with a wide variety of bars and eateries providing seafood and other food for lunch and dinner. Weather is pleasant during Winter months and…,3,48
"The Northern end (near Gracelands)  is nicer, with less people and cleaner water. For a couple hundred baht you can get a sun lounge under an umbrella for the day. Drinks are there and food carts. The security guys at Gracelands help you to navigate the road crossing. There's…",4,49
We went there on the 01/01/2020. Crowded but lots of activities. My granddaughter enjoyed herself. Sure will visit.again,4,18
"A lot of people, famous walking street - Bangla road is here. But if you come with children recommender find more quiet place for vacation.",2,25
"This beach probably is the worst in Phuket. Too many people, garbage left everywhere, very little swimming area, dirty water because most of it is taken by the watercraft and boats. Noisy because too close to the main road. Don't expect to lay down in paradise -it's not!",4,48
This beach is not the best in phuket. There are many beaches better and more clean to visit during your stay. It is location is amazing. Near patong market. I went to it only once during my stay.,4,38
"My husband, our 10 years old son and I went to Patong beach. My son like the beach so much. As u walk pass by, there will be locals promoting jetski & parachuting. They a bit quite pushy, we politely reject them as we are not interested, they keep mumbling non-stop. They are very rude & not friendly. Phuket is not a friendly spot. If can, try to avoid this place. Otherwise your holidays gonna be spoiled by their sh*t attitude",6,81
"Loungers and umberella cost 100 baths. They make sure there is no sand on lounger and place your towel on it Towels can be rented if needed. Plenty of women coming round to see if you want a drink or fresh fruit, all reasonably priced. Sea quite calm no big waves",4,51
All hotels are off the beach and that is ok. Make sure you get to the beach early to get a lounge chair. Reserve one with Alex the charge for 2 chairs and an umbrella is 200 Bhats. If you reserve for the next day it costs you 270 Bhats but you get preferential treatment and an extra umbrella. Eat the food off the carts on the beach it is amazingly good. Find If the ice cream guy he is very knowledgeable and can speak good English. Massages are better and less expensive off the beach. The water is amazing and the sun is very strong. I did not spend time in the sun and came back with a nice tan. Don’t bring too many clothes as laundry services are available everywhere for 50 Bhats per kilo. You can change money almost anywhere and the people are amazing. There are more 711 stores in Patong beach than in CANADA every street corner has at least one. Pharmacies are also everywhere. Eat street food at the night markets it is amazing. Have fun bring sun screen. Be careful crossing the streets as the experience is like dodging bulls. Russian roulette.,17,199
"Been to Thailand Bangkok, Phuket and Phi Phi Islands, but i would vouch for my days at Phuket, they were so awesome. the Place is so welcoming and so full of life, a lot of activities around the beach. and the waters are warm and so blue. if i am to come back to Thailand, all my days would be spent in Phuket along Patong Beach.",4,66
"Lovely clean beach with various things to do. Massages on the beach, jet skis and more. Close to the hotel and stunning views.",3,23
Great beach on Phuket. The town is a dump. They have roped areas for swimming. Chair and umbrella rentals are available for 200 Baht.,4,24
"This is not my kind of place at all. Too many bodies, chairs, beds, umbrellas all on top of each other. There is no personal space. It probably isn’t, but it feels dirty. Hated it.",5,35
Clean beach Too many people though and a lot of touting by people selling stuff. It’s annoying when you’re having a conversation with someone or enjoying a quiet moment staring into the sea and sunset with a beer.It’s worth a visit because it’s conveniently located beside Bangla street. Nice sun set but couldn’t see it setting over the horizon.Popular common Beach,5,61
The beach is generally clean with enough swimming space and planty of activities to do. It is also close to the shopping centers and restaurants. The loungers are reasonably priced.,3,30
"This beach has everything exactly where you need it. The people at the restaurants are super friendly. You have the options of umbrellas and chairs to enjoy some much needed shade. It is a great beach to swim at or try out some adventure sports. I personally enjoyed watching the gorgeous sunsets. It is really peaceful. If you looking for somewhere to see the New Year in, this is a great spot. If you have never been, check it out!",8,80
"It was our second stay there. Very nice place for swimming and sunbathing. Excelent service whole day, many offers from local sellers for many of local products or drinks. Behind the beach are many of streetpoints for local of Thai food.",5,41
